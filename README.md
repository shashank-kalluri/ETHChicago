# Reverberate
ETH Chicago Hackathon

Reverberate is a text based tool that allows users to develop their own trading strategies with only a text prompt. This is a complete code-free solution that allows non-technical users the flexibility to iterate on their trading strategies without ever writing a line of code. The code that is generated to match the prompt will then be backtested on trading data from Amberdata's API and the performance of the strategy will be provided in a graphical interface to the user. Users can then tweak the code generated by our program or iterate upon their prompt to better their strategy.
